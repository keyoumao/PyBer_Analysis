## Background and Results

### Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to create two additional technical analyses and a written report that delivers our results to the CEO.  
### Technical Analysis
Technical Analysis Deliverable 1: A DataFrame that summarizes the key metrics for the ride-sharing data by city type. 
Technical Analysis Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart, with one line for each city type, that shows the sum of the fares for each week. We used Pandas to create DataFrame summary for deliverable 1 and Matplotlib to plot line chart for deliverable 2.
